# Dining PhilosopheRS Problem

This is a recreation of my response to Programming Assignment 1 for CSC-265 using the Rust programming language
instead of C which was originally used. Despite my much more limited experience in the language, this solution
is much simpler with better input validation.

In addition to the core functionality, I am also working on a visualizer mode for the program. In this mode,
the progress of an individual philosopher. There would have to be a limit on how many philosophers are allowed
in this mode since there's a vertical restriction. Perhaps for an increase in the amount of philosophers that
can be visualized, a vertical presentation of the progress bars could be created. This would require I make a
rudimentary rendering engine for the terminal. I'd rather not reinvent the wheel in this instance.
